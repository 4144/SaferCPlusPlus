<h3>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>"SaferCPlusPlus" is essentially a collection of safe data types that are compatible with, and can substitute for, common unsafe native C++ types. Currently these include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <a href="#simple-benchmarks">fast</a>, <a href="#registered-pointers">safe replacement for native pointers</a> that, unlike std::shared_ptr for example, does not take ownership of the target (and so can point to objects on the stack).</p></li>
<li><p>A fast, safe <a href="#reference-counting-pointers">reference counting pointer</a> for all those situations when you, just for a moment, contemplated using an std::shared_ptr for something other than an object shared between asynchronous threads. Including <a href="#safely-passing-parameters-by-reference">safe parameter passing</a> by reference.</p></li>
<li><p>A "<a href="#scope-pointers">scope pointer</a>" for target objects allocated on the stack, or whose "owning" pointer is allocated on the stack. By default, not as safe as the other smart pointers in this library, but with zero runtime overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>An almost completely <a href="#vector">safe implementation</a> of std::vector&lt;&gt; - bounds checked, iterator checked and memory managed.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of <a href="#vectors">other</a> highly compatible vectors that address the issue of unnecessary iterator invalidation upon insert, erase or reallocation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#primitives">Replacements</a> for the native "int", "size_t" and "bool" types that ensure against the use of uninitialized values and address the "signed-unsigned mismatch" issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Data types for safe, simple <a href="#asynchronously-shared-objects">sharing</a> of objects among asynchronous threads.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tested with msvc2015 and g++5.3 (as of May 2016) and msvc2013 (as of Feb 2016). Support for versions of g++ prior to version 5 was dropped on Mar 21, 2016.</p>

<p>You can have a look at <a href="https://github.com/duneroadrunner/SaferCPlusPlus/blob/master/msetl_example.cpp">msetl_example.cpp</a> to see the library in action.</p>

<h3>
<a id="use-cases" class="anchor" href="#use-cases" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use cases</h3>

<p>This library is appropriate for use by two groups of C++ developers - those for whom safety and security are critical, and also everybody else.<br>
This library can help eliminate a lot of the opportunities for inadvertently accessing invalid memory or using uninitialized values. It essentially gets you a lot of the safety that you might get from, say Java, while retaining all of the power and most of the performance of C++.<br>
While using the library may sometimes cost a modest performance penalty, because the library elements are <a href="#compatibility-considerations">largely compatible</a> with their native counterparts they can be easily "disabled" (automatically replaced with their native counterparts) with a compile-time directive, allowing them to be used to help catch bugs in debug/test/beta builds while incurring no overhead in release builds.<br>
So there is really no excuse for not using the library in pretty much any situation.<br>
For more information on how the safe smart pointers in this library are intended to be used, see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1093894/How-To-Safely-Pass-Parameters-By-Reference-in-Cplu">this article</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="setup-and-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#setup-and-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup and dependencies</h3>

<p>The beauty of the library is that it is so small and simple. Using the library generally involves copying the include files you want to use into your project, and that's it. Outside of the stl, there are no other dependencies.<br>
A couple of notes about compling: With g++, you'll need to link to the pthread library (-lpthread). You may want to use the -Wno-unused flag as well. With 64-bit builds in msvc you may get a "<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8578y171(v=vs.140).aspx">fatal error C1128: number of sections exceeded object file format limit: compile with /bigobj</a>". Just <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173499.aspx">add</a> the "/bigobj" compile flag. For more help you can try the <a href="#questions-and-comments">questions and comments</a> section.</p>

<a id="safercplusplus-versus-clangllvm-sanitizers" class="anchor" href="#safercplusplus-versus-clangllvm-sanitizers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SaferCPlusPlus versus Clang/LLVM Sanitizers</h3>

<p>The Clang/LLVM compiler provides a set of "sanitizers" (adopted by gcc) that address C/C++ "code safety" issues. While they address many of the same bugs, the solutions provided by the SaferCPlusPlus library and the Clang/LLVM sanitizers differ in significant ways (as of Sep 2016). Namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Clang/LLVM sanitizers require modifications to the build process, not the code, whereas with SaferCPlusPlus it's the other way around.</li>
<li>SaferCPlusPlus can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer#Limitations">more completely</a> solve the problem of invalid memory access, but does so by restricting what qualifies as "proper" SaferCPlusPlus code (eg. no pointer arithmetic).</li>
<li>When encountering an invalid memory operation at run-time, the Clang/LLVM sanitizers terminate the executable, where SaferCPlusPlus throws a (catchable) exception. </li>
<li>SaferCPlusPlus is portable C++ code that works on any platform, whereas Clang/LLVM sanitizers are available/maintained on a finite (but at the moment, ample) set of OS-architecture combinations.</li>
<li>The Clang/LLVM sanitizers cost more in terms of run-time performance. <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerPerformanceNumbers">~2x slowdown</a> for the AddressSanitizer, for example. SaferCPlusPlus <a href="#simple-benchmarks">doesn't cost</a> nearly that much in typical code. This is mainly because the Clang/LLVM sanitizers cannot assume any cooperation from the source code, so they have to instrument pretty much every allocated piece of memory and check pretty well every pointer dereference.</li>
<li>SaferCPlusPlus supports the mixing of "safe" and (high-performance) "unsafe" code at a granular level, where Clang/LLVM Sanitizers apply to entire modules, or as in the case of the MemorySanitizer, all modules, requiring recompilation of any linked libraries.</li>
<li>Clang's ThreadSanitizer tries to detect data race bugs, while SaferCPlusPlus provides <a href="#asynchronously-shared-objects">data types</a> that eliminate the possibility of data race bugs (and a superset we call "object race" bugs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Clang/LLVM Sanitizers are intended for debugging purposes, not to be used in deployed executables. As such, by design, some of their debugging convenience features themselves introduce <a href="http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/363">opportunities</a> for malicious exploitation. SaferCPlusPlus on the other hand, is designed to be used in deployed executables, as well as for debugging and testing. And that's reflected in its performance, security and "completeness of solution". So it's not really SaferCPlusPlus "versus" Clang/LLVM Sanitizers. They are not incompatible, and there's no reason you couldn't use both simultaneously, although there would be significant redundancies.</p>

<h3>
<a id="safercplusplus-versus-checked-c" class="anchor" href="#safercplusplus-versus-checked-c" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SaferCPlusPlus versus Checked C</h3>

<p>"Checked C", like SaferCPlusPlus, takes the approach of extending the language with safer elements that can directly substitute for unsafe native elements. In chapter 9 of their <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/releases/download/v0.5-final/checkedc-v0.5.pdf">spec</a>, there is an extensive survey of existing (and historical) efforts to address C/C++ memory safety. There they make the argument for the (heretofore neglected) "language extension" approach (basically citing performance, compatibility and the support for granular mixing of safe and unsafe code), that applies to SaferCPlusPlus as well.</p>

<p>Checked C and SaferCPlusPlus are more complementary that competitive. Checked C targets low-level system C code and basically only addresses the array bounds checking issue, including pointer arithmetic, where SaferCPlusPlus skews more toward C++ code and legacy code that would benefit from being converted to modern C++. It seems that Checked C is not yet ready for deployment (as of Sep 2016), but one could imagine both solutions being used, with little contention, in projects that have both low-level system type code and higher-level application type code.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="registered-pointers" class="anchor" href="#registered-pointers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Registered pointers</h3>

<p>"Registered" pointers are intended to behave just like native C++ pointers, except that their value is (automatically) set to nullptr when the target object is destroyed. And by default they will throw an exception upon any attempt to dereference a nullptr. Because they don't take ownership like some other smart pointers, they can point to objects allocated on the stack as well as the heap. In most cases, they can be used as a compatible, direct substitute for native pointers, making it straightforward to update legacy code (to be safer).</p>

<p>Registered pointers come in two flavors - <a href="#tregisteredpointer">TRegisteredPointer</a> and <a href="#trelaxedregisteredpointer">TRelaxedRegisteredPointer</a>. They are both very similar. TRegisteredPointer emphasizes speed and safety a bit more, while TRelaxedRegisteredPointer emphasizes compatibility and flexibility a bit more. If you want to undertake the task of en masse replacement of native pointers in legacy code, or need to interact with legacy native pointer interfaces, TRelaxedRegisteredPointer may be more convenient.</p>

<p>Note that these registered pointers cannot target types that cannot act as base classes. The primitive types like int, bool, etc. <a href="#compatibility-considerations">cannot act as base classes</a>. Fortunately, the library provides safer <a href="#primitives">substitutes</a> for int, bool and size_t that can act as base classes. Also note that pointers that can point to the stack are inherently not thread safe. While we <a href="#on-thread-safety">do not encourage</a> the casual sharing of objects between asynchronous threads, if you need to do so consider using the <a href="#asynchronously-shared-objects">safe sharing data types</a> in this library. For more information on how the safe smart pointers in this library are intended to be used, see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1093894/How-To-Safely-Pass-Parameters-By-Reference-in-Cplu">this article</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tregisteredpointer" class="anchor" href="#tregisteredpointer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TRegisteredPointer</h3>

<p>usage example:</p>

<pre><code>#include "mseregistered.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    class CA {
    public:
        CA(int x) : m_x(x) {}
        int m_x;
    };

    mse::TRegisteredPointer&lt;CA&gt; a_ptr;
    CA a2_obj(2);
    {
        // mse::TRegisteredObj&lt;CA&gt; is a class publicly derived from CA

        mse::TRegisteredObj&lt;CA&gt; a_obj(1); // a_obj is entirely on the stack

        a_ptr = &amp;a_obj;
        a2_obj = (*a_ptr);
    }
    if (a_ptr) {
        assert(false);
    } else {
        try {
            a2_obj = (*a_ptr);
        }
        catch (...) {
            // expected exception
        }
    }

    a_ptr = mse::registered_new&lt;CA&gt;(3); // heap allocation
    mse::registered_delete&lt;CA&gt;(a_ptr);
}

<h3>
<a id="tregisterednotnullpointer" class="anchor" href="#tregisterednotnullpointer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TRegisteredNotNullPointer</h3>

<p>Same as TRegisteredPointer, but cannot be constructed to a null value.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tregisteredfixedpointer" class="anchor" href="#tregisteredfixedpointer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TRegisteredFixedPointer</h3>

<p>Same as TRegisteredNotNullPointer, but cannot be retargeted after construction (basically a "const TRegisteredNotNullPointer"). It is essentially a functional equivalent of a C++ reference and is a recommended type to be used for safe parameter passing by reference.  </p>

<p>usage example:</p>

<pre><code>#include "mseregistered.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    class CA {
    public:
        CA(std::string str) : m_str(str) {}
        std::string m_str;
    };

    class CB {
    public:
        static void foo(mse::TRegisteredFixedConstPointer&lt;CA&gt; input1_fc_ptr, mse::TRegisteredFixedConstPointer&lt;CA&gt; 
            input2_fc_ptr, mse::TRegisteredFixedPointer&lt;CA&gt; output_f_ptr) {
            output_f_ptr-&gt;m_str = "output from " + input1_fc_ptr-&gt;m_str + " and " + input2_fc_ptr-&gt;m_str;

    mse::TRegisteredObj&lt;CA&gt; out_obj("");

    CB::foo(&amp;in1_obj, &amp;(*in2_reg_ptr), &amp;out_obj);

    mse::registered_delete&lt;CA&gt;(in2_reg_ptr);

<p>TRegisteredPointer&lt;X&gt; does implicitly convert to TRegisteredPointer&lt;const X&gt;. But some prefer to think of the pointer giving "const" access to the object rather than giving access to a "const object".</p>

<h3>
<a id="tsyncweakfixedpointer" class="anchor" href="#tsyncweakfixedpointer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TSyncWeakFixedPointer</h3>

<p>TSyncWeakFixedPointer is primarily intended to be used as a safe pointer to a member of a registered object in cases where for some reason you can't, or don't want to, make the member itself a registered object. TSyncWeakFixedPointer essentially acts as a pointer to the member (or whatever object you specify), while keeping a copy of a registered pointer to the object. It uses the registered pointer to ensure that it is safe to access the object. Use mse::make_syncweak() to construct a TSyncWeakFixedPointer.<br>
What's with the name? "SyncWeak" is short for "sychronous weak", as opposed to "asynchronous weak". "Non-owning" pointers that support objects shared between asynchronous threads, like std::weak_ptr, cannot be used to access the object directly. If, on the other hand, asynchronous sharing is not supported, then a non-owning pointer (with the appropriate safety mechanisms), like TRegisteredPointer, can be used to access the object directly. There is a corresponding <a href="#tstrongfixedpointer">TStrongFixedPointer</a>.  </p>

<p>usage example:</p>

<pre><code>#include "mseregistered.h"

class H {
public:
    template&lt;class _TString1Pointer, class _TString2Pointer&gt;
    static std::string foo6(_TString1Pointer i1ptr, _TString2Pointer i2ptr) {
        return (*i1ptr) + (*i2ptr);
    }

protected:
    ~H() {}
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    /* Obtaining safe pointers to members of registered objects: */
    class E {
    public:
        virtual ~E() {}
        mse::TRegisteredObj&lt;std::string&gt; reg_s = "some text ";
        std::string s2 = "some other text ";
    };

    mse::TRegisteredObj&lt;E&gt; registered_e;
    mse::TRegisteredPointer&lt;E&gt; E_registered_ptr1 = &amp;registered_e;

    /* The easiest way is to obtain a safe pointer to a member of a registered object is to make the
    member itself a registered object. */
    mse::TRegisteredPointer&lt;std::string&gt; string_registered_ptr1 = &amp;(E_registered_ptr1-&gt;reg_s);

    /* Another option is to make a TSyncWeakFixedPointer. syncweak_string_ptr1 here is essentially
    a pointer to "E.s2" (string member of class E) with a registered pointer to E to in its pocket.
    It uses the registered pointer to ensure that it is safe to access the object. */
    auto syncweak_string_ptr1 = mse::make_syncweak(E_registered_ptr1-&gt;s2, E_registered_ptr1);

    /* In practice, rather than declaring a specific mse::TSyncWeakFixedPointer parameter, we expect
    functions to be "templatized" so that they can accept any type of pointer. */
    std::string res1 = H::foo6(syncweak_string_ptr1, syncweak_string_ptr1);
}

<p>Take these results with a grain of salt. The benchmarks were run on a noisy machine, and anyway don't represent realistic usage scenarios. But I'm guessing the general gist of the results is valid. Interestingly, three of the scenarios seemed to have gotten noticeably faster between msvc2013 and msvc2015.<br>
I'm speculating here, but it might be the case that the heap operations that occur in this benchmark may be more "cache friendly" than heap operations in real world code would be, making the "heap" results look artificially good (relative to the "stack" result).</p>

<p>The interesting thing here is that checking for nullptr seems to have gotten a lot slower between msvc2013 and msvc2015. But anyway, my guess is that pointer dereferencing is such a fast operation (std::weak_ptr aside) that outside of critical inner loops, the overhead of checking for nullptr would generally be probably pretty modest.<br>
Also note that <a href="#trefcountingnotnullpointer">mse::TRefCountingNotNullPointer</a> and <a href="#trefcountingfixedpointer">mse::TRefCountingFixedPointer</a> always point to a validly allocated object, so their dereferences don't need to be checked. mse::TRegisteredPointer's safety mechanisms are not compatible with the techniques used by the benchmark to isolate dereferencing performance, but mse::TRegisteredPointer's dereferencing performance would be expected to be essentially identical to that of mse::TRelaxedRegisteredPointer. By default, scope pointers have identical performance to native pointers.</p>

<p>If you're going to use pointers, then to ensure they won't be used to access invalid memory you basically have two options - detect any attempt to do so and throw an exception, or, alternatively, ensure that the pointer targets a validly allocated object. Registered pointers rely on the former, and so-called "reference counting" pointers can be used to achieve the latter. The most famous reference counting pointer is std::shared_ptr, which is notable for its thread-safe reference counting that's rather handy when you're sharing an object among asynchronous threads, but unnecessarily costly when you aren't. So we provide fast reference counting pointers that <a href="#on-thread-safety">forego</a> any thread safety mechanisms. In addition to being substantially faster (and smaller) than std::shared_ptr, they are a bit more safety oriented in that they they don't support construction from raw pointers. (Use mse::make_refcounting&lt;&gt;() instead.) "Const", "not null" and "fixed" (non-retargetable) flavors are also provided with proper conversions between them. For more information on how the safe smart pointers in this library are intended to be used, see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1093894/How-To-Safely-Pass-Parameters-By-Reference-in-Cplu">this article</a>.</p>

<p>TStrongFixedPointer is primarily intended to be used as a safe pointer to a member of a class/struct owned by a reference counting pointer. TStrongFixedPointer essentially acts as a pointer to the member (or whatever object you specify), while keeping a copy of the reference counting pointer (or whatever owner you specify) to ensure that the object is not deallocated while you're still using it. Use mse::make_strong() to construct a TStrongFixedPointer.  </p>

<p>Scope pointers are different from other smart pointers in the library in that, by default, they have no runtime safety enforcement mechanism, and the compile-time safety mechanisms aren't (yet) quite sufficient to ensure that they will be used in an intrinsically safe manner. Scope pointers point to scope objects. Scope objects are objects that are allocated on the stack, or whose "owning" pointer is allocated on the stack. So basically the object is destroyed when it, or it's owner, goes out of scope. The purpose of scope pointers and objects is to identify a class of situations that are simple and deterministic enough that no (runtime) safety mechanisms are necessary. In theory, a tool could be constructed to verify that scope pointers are used in a safe manner at compile-time. But in the mean time we provide the option of using a relaxed registered pointer as the scope pointer's base class for enhanced safety and to help catch misuse. Defining MSE_SCOPEPOINTER_USE_RELAXED_REGISTERED will cause relaxed registered pointers to be used in debug mode. Additionally defining MSE_SCOPEPOINTER_RUNTIME_CHECKS_ENABLED will cause them to be used in non-debug modes as well. And as with registered pointers, scope pointers cannot target types that cannot act as a base class. For int, bool and size_t use the safer <a href="#primitives">substitutes</a> that can act as base classes.</p>

<p>There are two types of scope pointers, <a href="#txscopefixedpointer">TXScopeFixedPointer</a> and <a href="#txscopeownerpointer">TXScopeOwnerPointer</a>. TXScopeOwnerPointer is similar to boost::scoped_ptr in functionality (but more limited in intended use). It creates an instance of a given class on the heap and destroys that instance in its destructor. (We use "scope" to mean "execution scope", where in boost it seems to refer to "declaration scope".) TXScopeFixedPointer is a "non-owning" (or "weak") pointer to a scope object. It is (intentionally) limited in it's functionality, and is intended pretty much for the sole purpose of passing scope objects by reference as function arguments. For more information on how the safe smart pointers in this library are intended to be used, see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1093894/How-To-Safely-Pass-Parameters-By-Reference-in-Cplu">this article</a>.</p>

<p>TXScopeOwnerPointer is similar to boost::scoped_ptr in functionality, but more limited in intended use. In particular, TXScopeOwnerPointer is not intended to be used as a member of any class or struct. Use it when you want to give scope lifetime to objects that are too large to be declared directly on the stack. Also, instead of its constructor taking a native pointer pointing to the already allocated object, it allocates the object itself and passes its contruction arguments to the object's constructor.  </p>

<a id="poly-pointers" class="anchor" href="#poly-pointers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Poly pointers</h3>

<p>Ideally you won't need  to use these. Poly pointers can act as either a strong/owning pointer or weak/non-owning pointer, as needed. Generally, poly pointers would be expected to be used as function parameters. For functions intended for general use that take reference parameters, it is recommended that you "<a href="#safely-passing-parameters-by-reference">templatize</a>" the function so that it can take any type of (smart) pointer reference the caller chooses. But if for some reason you can't or don't want to templatize the function, but still want to give the caller some flexibility in terms of pointer reference parameters then you might consider using a poly pointer. While convenient, poly pointers may have a small run-time cost.  </p>

<p>There are currently three types of poly pointer available (and their "const" counterparts) - TRefCountingOrXScopeFixedPointer, TRefCountingOrXScopeOrRawFixedPointer and TSharedOrRawFixedPointer. When constructed from a strong/owning pointer (i.e. a refcounting pointer or an std::shared_ptr), the poly pointer will obtain and hold (shared) ownership of the target object.</p>

<p>Same as TRefCountingOrXScopeFixedPointer, but also supports construction from "raw" pointers.

<p>As has been shown, you can use <a href="#registered-pointers">registered pointers</a>, <a href="#reference-counting-pointers">reference counting pointers</a> and <a href="#scope-pointers">scope pointers</a> to safely pass parameters by reference. (Well, scope pointers aren't completely safe yet, but "safer" anyway.) If you're writing a function for general use, we recommend that you "templatize" the function so that it can accept any type of pointer. This is demonstrated in the <a href="#trefcountingofregisteredpointer">TRefCountingOfRegisteredPointer</a> usage example. Or you can read an article about it <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1093894/How-To-Safely-Pass-Parameters-By-Reference-in-Cplu">here</a>. If for some reason you can't or don't want to templatize the function, but still want to give the caller some flexibility in terms of pointer reference parameters then you can use a <a href="#poly-pointers">poly pointer</a> like TRefCountingOrXScopeFixedPointer. </p>

<h3>
<a id="asynchronously-shared-objects" class="anchor" href="#asynchronously-shared-objects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Asynchronously shared objects</h3>

<p>One situation where safety mechanisms are particularly important is when sharing objects between asynchronous threads. In particular, when one party (thread) is modifying an object, you want to ensure that no other party accesses it. So we provide TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester that (like std::shared_ptr) possesses shared ownership of an object to be shared among asynchronous threads, and provides (const and non-const smart) pointers that can be used to safely access the object. For a more information and examples, see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1106491/Sharing-Objects-Between-Threads-in-Cplusplus-the-S">this article</a>. At the moment, these data types cannot target types that cannot act as a base class. If you want to share an int, bool or size_t, use the <a href="#primitives">safer substitutes</a> that can act as base classes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tasyncsharedreadwriteaccessrequester" class="anchor" href="#tasyncsharedreadwriteaccessrequester" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester</h3>

<p>Use the writelock_ptr() and readlock_ptr() member functions to obtain pointers to the shared object. Those functions will block until they can obtain the needed lock on the shared object. The obtained pointers will hold on to their lock for as long as they exist. Their locks are released when the pointers are destroyed (generally when they go out of scope).  </p>

<p>Use mse::make_asyncsharedreadwrite&lt;&gt;() to obtain a TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester. TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester can be copied and passed-by-value as a parameter (to another thread, generally).</p>

<p>Non-blocking try_writelock_ptr() and try_readlock_ptr() member functions are also available. As are the limited-blocking try_writelock_ptr_for(), try_readlock_ptr_for(), try_writelock_ptr_until() and try_readlock_ptr_until().</p>

<h3>
<a id="tasyncsharedreadonlyaccessrequester" class="anchor" href="#tasyncsharedreadonlyaccessrequester" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TAsyncSharedReadOnlyAccessRequester</h3>

<p>Same as TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester, but only supports readlock_ptr(), not writelock_ptr(). You can use mse::make_asyncsharedreadonly&lt;&gt;() to obtain a TAsyncSharedReadOnlyAccessRequester. TAsyncSharedReadOnlyAccessRequester can also be copy constructed from a TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tasyncsharedobjectthatyouaresurehasnounprotectedmutablesreadwriteaccessrequester-tasyncsharedobjectthatyouaresurehasnounprotectedmutablesreadonlyaccessrequester" class="anchor" href="#tasyncsharedobjectthatyouaresurehasnounprotectedmutablesreadwriteaccessrequester-tasyncsharedobjectthatyouaresurehasnounprotectedmutablesreadonlyaccessrequester" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TAsyncSharedObjectThatYouAreSureHasNoUnprotectedMutablesReadWriteAccessRequester, TAsyncSharedObjectThatYouAreSureHasNoUnprotectedMutablesReadOnlyAccessRequester</h3>

<p>A peculiarity of C++ is that a "const" object is not necessarily guaranteed to be unmodifiable. Specifically in cases where the object has "mutable" members. So, out of an abundance of prudence TAsyncSharedReadWriteAccessRequester and TAsyncSharedReadOnlyAccessRequester do not allow for the simultaneous existence of multiple "readlock_ptr"s. But sometimes you really want to allow for multiple simultaneous readers. So we provide these versions with unwieldy names to remind you of the potential dangers of shared objects with mutable members. Ideally, at some point in the future, we'd be able to determine at compile-time whether or not a type has mutable members.</p>

<a id="tstdsharedimmutablefixedpointer" class="anchor" href="#tstdsharedimmutablefixedpointer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TStdSharedImmutableFixedPointer</h3>

<p>For "read-only" situations when you need, or want, the shared object to be managed by std::shared_ptrs we provide a slightly safety-enhanced wrapper for std::shared_ptr. The wrapper enforces "const"ness and tries to ensure that it points to a validly allocated object. Use mse::make_stdsharedimmutable&lt;&gt;() to construct an mse::TStdSharedImmutableFixedPointer. And again, beware of sharing objects with mutable members.  </p>

<p>These classes are meant to behave like, and be compatible with their native counterparts. In debug mode, they check for "use before initialization", and in release mode, they use default initialization to help ensure deterministic behavior. Upon value assignment, CInt and CSize_t will check to ensure that the value fits within the type's range. CSize_t's <code>-=</code> operator checks that the operation evaluates to a positive value. And unlike its native counterpart, arithmetic operations involving CSize_t that could evaluate to a negative number are returned as a (signed) CInt.</p>

<p>Quarantined types are meant to hold values that are obtained from user input or some other untrusted source (like a media file for example). These are not yet available in the library, but are an important concept with respect to safe programming. Values obtained from untrusted sources are the main attack vector of malicious actors and should be handled with special care. For example, the so-called "stagefright" vulnerability in the Android OS is the result of a specially crafted media file causing the sum of integers to overflow.<br>
It is often the case that untrusted values are obtained through intrinsically slow communication mediums (i.e. file system, internet, UI, etc.), so it often makes no perceptible difference whether the code that processes those untrusted values into "trusted" internal values is optimized for performance or not. So don't hesitate to use whatever safety methods are called for. In particular, integer types with more comprehensive range checking can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/robertramey/safe_numerics">https://github.com/robertramey/safe_numerics</a>.</p>

<a id="vectors" class="anchor" href="#vectors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vectors</h3>

<p>We provide three vectors - <a href="#vector">mstd::vector&lt;&gt;</a>, <a href="#msevector">msevector&lt;&gt;</a> and <a href="#ivector">ivector&lt;&gt;</a>. mstd::vector&lt;&gt; is simply an almost completely safe implementation of std::vector&lt;&gt;.
msevector&lt;&gt; is also quite safe. Not quite as safe as mstd::vector&lt;&gt;, but it requires less overhead. msevector&lt;&gt; also supports a new kind of iterator in addition to the standard vector iterator. This new iterator, called "ipointer", acts more like a list iterator. It's more intuitive, more useful, and isn't prone to being invalidated upon an insert or delete operation. If performance is of concern, msevector&lt;&gt; is probably the better choice of the three.
ivector&lt;&gt; is just as safe as mstd::vector&lt;&gt;, but drops support for the (problematic) standard vector iterators and only supports the ipointer iterators.</p>

<a id="vector" class="anchor" href="#vector" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>vector</h3>

<p>mstd::vector&lt;&gt; is simply an almost completely safe implementation of std::vector&lt;&gt;.</p>

<p>usage example:</p>

<pre><code>#include "msemstdvector.h"
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

    mse::mstd::vector&lt;int&gt; mv;
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; sv;
    /* These two vectors should be completely interchangeable. The difference being that mv should throw
    an exception on any attempt to access invalid memory. */
}
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="msevector" class="anchor" href="#msevector" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>msevector</h3>

<p>If you're willing to forego a little theoretical safety, msevector&lt;&gt; is still very safe without the overhead of memory management.<br>
In addition to the (high performance) standard vector iterator, msevector&lt;&gt; also supports a new kind of iterator, called "ipointer", that acts more like a list iterator in the sense that it points to an item rather than a position, and like a list iterator, it is not invalidated by insertions or deletions occurring elsewhere in the container, even if a "reallocation" occurs. In fact, standard vector iterators are so prone to being invalidated that for algorithms involving insertion or deletion, they can be generously considered not very useful, and more prudently considered dangerous. ipointers, aside from being safe, just make sense. Algorithms that work when applied to list iterators will work when applied to ipointers. And that's important as Bjarne famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo">points out</a>, for cache coherency reasons, in most cases vectors should be used in place of lists, even when lists are conceptually more appropriate. You can read a short article comparing ipointers with some existing alternatives <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1087021/Stable-Iterators-for-Cplusplus-Vectors-and-Why-You">here</a>.<br>
msevector&lt;&gt; also provides a safe (bounds checked) version of the standard vector iterator.</p>

<p>usage example:</p>

<pre><code>#include "msemsevector.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

    mse::msevector&lt;int&gt; v1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    mse::msevector&lt;int&gt; v = v1;
    {
        mse::msevector&lt;int&gt;::ipointer ip1 = v.ibegin();
        ip1 += 2;
        assert(3 == (*ip1));
        auto ip2 = v.ibegin(); /* ibegin() returns an ipointer */
        v.erase(ip2); /* remove the first item */
        assert(3 == (*ip1)); /* ip1 continues to point to the same item, not the same position */
        ip1--;
        assert(2 == (*ip1));
        for (mse::msevector&lt;int&gt;::cipointer cip = v.cibegin(); v.ciend() != cip; cip++) {
            /* You might imagine what would happen if cip were a regular vector iterator. */
            v.insert(v.ibegin(), (*cip));
        }
    }
    v = v1;
    {
        /* This code block is equivalent to the previous code block, but uses ipointer's more "readable" interface
        that might make the code a little more clear to those less familiar with C++ syntax. */
        mse::msevector&lt;int&gt;::ipointer ip_vit1 = v.ibegin();
        ip_vit1.advance(2);
        assert(3 == ip_vit1.item());
        auto ip_vit2 = v.ibegin();
        v.erase(ip_vit2);
        assert(3 == ip_vit1.item());
        ip_vit1.set_to_previous();
        assert(2 == ip_vit1.item());
        mse::msevector&lt;int&gt;::cipointer cip(v);
        for (cip.set_to_beginning(); cip.points_to_an_item(); cip.set_to_next()) {
            v.insert_before(v.ibegin(), (*cip));
        }
    }

    /* Btw, ipointers are compatible with stl algorithms, like any other stl iterators. */
    std::sort(v.ibegin(), v.iend());

    /* And just to be clear, mse::msevector&lt;&gt; retains it's original (high performance) stl::vector iterators. */
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    /* mse::msevector&lt;&gt; also provides "safe" (bounds checked) versions of the original stl::vector iterators. */
    std::sort(v.ss_begin(), v.ss_end());
}

<p>ipointers support all the standard iterator operators, but also have member functions with "friendlier" names including:</p>

<pre><code>bool points_to_an_item() const;
bool points_to_end_marker() const;
bool points_to_beginning() const;
/* has_next_item_or_end_marker() is just an alias for points_to_an_item(). */
bool has_next_item_or_end_marker() const;
/* has_next() is just an alias for points_to_an_item() that may be familiar to java programmers. */
bool has_next() const;
bool has_previous() const;
void set_to_beginning();
void set_to_end_marker();
void set_to_next();
void set_to_previous();
void advance(difference_type n);
void regress(difference_type n);
reference item() const { return operator*(); }
reference previous_item() const;
CSize_t position() const;
void reset();

<h3>
<a id="ivector" class="anchor" href="#ivector" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ivector</h3>

<p>ivector is for cases when safety and correctness are higher priorities than compatibility and performance. ivector, like mstd::vector&lt;&gt;, is almost completely safe. ivector takes the further step of dropping support for the (problematic) standard vector iterator, and replacing it with <a href="#msevector">ipointer</a>.</p>

<p>usage example:</p>

<pre><code>#include "mseivector.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

    mse::ivector&lt;int&gt; iv = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    std::sort(iv.begin(), iv.end());
    mse::ivector&lt;int&gt;::ipointer ivip = iv.begin();

<h3>
<a id="compatibility-considerations" class="anchor" href="#compatibility-considerations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility considerations</h3>

<p>People have asked why the primitive C++ types can't be used as base classes - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2143020/why-cant-i-inherit-from-int-in-c">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2143020/why-cant-i-inherit-from-int-in-c</a>. It turns out that really the only reason primitive types weren't made into full-fledged classes is that they inherit these "chaotic" conversion rules from C that can't be fully mimicked by C++ classes, and Bjarne thought it would be too ugly to try to make special case classes that followed different conversion rules.<br>
But while substitute classes cannot be 100% compatible substitutes for their corresponding primitives, they can still be mostly compatible. And if you're writing new code or maintaining existing code, it should be considered good coding practice to ensure that your code is compatible with C++'s conversion rules for classes and not dependent on the "chaotic" legacy conversion rules of primitive types.</p>

<p>If you are using legacy code or libraries where it's not practical to update the code, it shouldn't be a problem to continue using primitive types there and the safer substitute classes elsewhere in the code. The safer substitute classes generally have no problem interacting with primitive types, although in some cases you may need to do some explicit type casting. <a href="#registered-pointers">Registered pointers</a> can be cast to raw pointers, and, for example, <a href="#primitives">CInt</a> can participate in arithmetic operations with regular ints.</p>

<h3>
<a id="on-thread-safety" class="anchor" href="#on-thread-safety" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On thread safety</h3>

<p>The choice to not include thread safety mechanisms in most of the types in this library is a deliberate one. If the goal is code safety, then we strongly discourage the casual sharing of objects between asynchronous threads (i.e. without the proper safety mechanisms). The practice of sharing objects between asynchronous threads can be prone to severe and insidious bugs that are particularly adept at evading exposure during testing. In cases where it's not practical to avoid the practice, we suggest doing so only in the context of some kind of system that comprehensively ensures against inadvertent unsafe access. For most straight-forward cases you can use the <a href="#asynchronously-shared-objects">asynchronous sharing data types</a> in this library.
To be clear, we are not discouraging asynchronous programming, or even inter-thread communication in general. Just the "casual" sharing of objects between asynchronous threads.</p>
